Creating an API for spectrometer and motor controller

Some GOATED githubs:
[SeaBreeze](https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze): Lets you use Ocean Optics spectrometer through python
[SeaTease](https://github.com/jonathanvanschenck/python-seatease): Simulates Ocean Optics spectrometer to test code without need of physical spectrometer
[ThorLabs Motor Stepper](https://github.com/rwalle/py_thorlabs_ctrl/blob/master/py_thorlabs_ctrl/kinesis/motor.py): Code to interface with Thorlabs motor via python. Not exactly what I implemented, but helpful reference to functions in the Thorlabs dll.
